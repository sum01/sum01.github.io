# Vcash Mining Calculator

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/sum01/vcash-calculator/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/sum01/vcash-calculator/commits/master)

A simple calculator that takes some input and calculates your estimated profit, average mined, and power cost for each day/week/month/year.

All pricing info is pulled from the [public Bittrex API](https://www.bittrex.com/Home/Api), and network information is pulled from [xCore's Vcash explorer API.](https://explorer.vcash.info/info)

Note: The current network hashrate can change quickly, and calculations depend on it, so results may vary.

## Bittrex removed Vcash

Since Bittrex removed Vcash, this will no longer work, as it depended on their API for pricing information.

Until Vcash is traded on an exchange again there won't be any way to make this work.
